Summary
=======

It is now time to review what we have learned since the last Summary.

We have seen our first Python keywords, ``def``, ``from``, ``import``.

We have seen the concept of looping, and a keyword unique
to Reeborg's World: ``repeat``.

We have seen a sixth function specific to Reeborg's World, that is
``build_wall()``, in addition to the five we had seen before:

-  ``move()``
-  ``turn_left()``
-  ``take()``
-  ``put()``
-  ``pause()``

We are now ready to learn about some very important programming concepts
dealing with deciding automatically between different possibilities.

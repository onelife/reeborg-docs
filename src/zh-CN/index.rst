Learn Python with Reeborg!
==========================


Learning Python is easy with Reeborg.  All you have to do is read the tutorial
and try all the examples in `Reeborg's world <http://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python>`_.
I suggest that you keep the tutorial and Reeborg's World both open but
in separate windows or tabs.

Before you actually start the tutorial, have Reeborg take its first step
by running a program in `Reeborg's world <http://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python>`_.


Hints are clickable and designed to provide useful pointers if you are
not sure how to proceed.

.. hint::

    Go to `Reeborg's world <http://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python>`_, click on the "run" button
    (small white triangle on blue background)
    and watch Reeborg takes its first step.
    You can also `view this short video <http://youtu.be/yTdw97KNgGM>`_

**Reeborg's World has been designed for you!**

The idea I had in mind when I created Reeborg's World was to create
a friendly place to learn programming concepts.
While it is possible to use Javascript, the "normal" language of the web,
as a programming language to make Reeborg work,
I've decided to focus on Python which is a more
versatile language and one that is easier to use by beginners and
advanced programmers alike.

This tutorial was first written for you and help you learn computer programming.
However, I have also included
some information for teachers as well as other users of Reeborg's World.
You can ignore such additional information without worrying that you are
missing something important as you are learning programming concepts.

This document has been divided into nine major parts.

.. admonition:: For educators

       program precursor to Reeborg's World.*


    Reeborg's World had been strongly inspired by Richard Pattis's
    `Karel the robot`_.
    Three programming languages (Python, Javascript and CoffeeScript)
    can be used to control the virtual robot.
    However, this tutorial is focuses on Python which is my favourite
    programming language and that many consider to be an ideal language
    to teach programming concepts to beginners.

    .. _Karel the robot: http://www.amazon.ca/Karel-Robot-Gentle-Introduction-Programming/dp/0471089281/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1440177128&sr=1-6

    In this tutorial, I postpone the introduction of variables as long as
    possible, and do the same for function arguments.
    This approach reflects that of Pattis's original Karel which did
    not have any variables.  This is the focus of the first two
    main parts of this tutorial, namely **Basic tutorial** and **Recursion**.

    Reeborg's World has been created with the goal of simplifying Pattis's
    idea as much as possible, while still making it possible to
    introduce very advanced programming concepts.  So, instead of the
    "simple" **first program** found in some tutorials supposedly aimed
    at complete beginners:

    .. code-block:: java

        public class HelloWorld {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello, World");
            }
        }

    the simplest valid program in Reeborg's World is::

        move()

    That's it: a single instruction.  What could be simpler when
    teaching beginners?

    However, one is not limited to simple functions.
    For example, if one wants to use an OOP approach instead,
    the simplest valid program, which has Reeborg actually do the
    equivalent to the single ``move()`` instruction above, is::

        reeborg = UsedRobot()
        reeborg.move()

    Similarly, because using standard libraries is something useful, students
    can first learn about libraries by writing their own code and, in doing so,
    they learn that library modules are just programs like any others.
    Assuming they have defined a function, say ``turn_right()``, in their library,
    the following program will be valid:

    .. code-block:: python

        from library import turn_right
        turn_right()

    So, the idea is to have the student deal with as few concepts as possible
    to write programs, only learning new concepts (such as using variables,
    or Object-Oriented notation, or importing code from a library)
    after they have learned the basics.
    One guiding principle in writing this tutorial has been to introduce
    only one programming concept at a time.

    However, the simplicity of the approach used in Reeborg's World
    does not mean that what can be done is limited to the basics of the
    virtual robot world.
    The Python version of Reeborg's World is based on Brython_, and includes
    many Python modules found in Python's standard library which can be used
    to write advanced programs.

    **Task Driven Learning**

    Reeborg's World is designed for *Task Driven Learning*: students are given
    tasks that Reeborg has to complete, and they must write programs instructing
    Reeborg how to do so.

    Tasks include having Reeborg move objects, build walls, or go to a
    particular location.  Objects in Reeborg's World are colourful; the
    places they be must moved to by Reeborg are indicated by having a
    picture of the object in shades of grey.

    If you have some examples (particularly tasks for Reeborg)
    that you find useful for your students, I would appreciate
    if you could share them with me so as to improve this tutorial.

    **Free**

    Reeborg's World is **free**: *free* to use, *free* to copy (and put on a school's
    website), and does not require any registration or login.
    Unlike some other existing code learning website, it does not force
    learners to follow a pre-defined path; educators are *free* to create their
    own learning material while making use of Reeborg's World.
